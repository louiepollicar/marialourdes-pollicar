1. Findings from your charters. Did everything work as expected? What bugs were discovered?
<br> Transfer Account - I was expecting that the transfer will be recorded when "All Accounts" is selected since this is visible when the user switches from one account to another.
2. Prioritisation of those charters - which area of the app or testing would you explore first and why?
<br> Adding Income, Expense, and Checking if the balance is correct would be the top priority since the app's goal is to help the user track spendings and income better and having an issue on this would defeat its purpose.
3. How much time you have planned for each charter?
<br> 20-30 minutes is allotted for each charter
4. What kind of risks you need to mitigate for this type of application?
<br> Security risk is on the top of the list since the application contains sensitive information, especially when it is synchronized with other applications or services like Google Drive and Dropbox.
